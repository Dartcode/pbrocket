Interpolation modes
-------------------
Each keyframe has an interpolation mode associated with it, and that
interpolation mode is valid until the next keyframe is reached. The different
interpolation modes are the following:

* Step   : This is the simplest mode, and always returns the key's value.
* Linear : This does a linear interpolation between the current and the next
           key's values.
* Smooth : This interpolates in a smooth fashion, the exact function is what
           is usually called "smoothstep". Do not confuse this mode with
           splines; this only interpolates smoothly between two different
           values, it does not try to calculate tangents or any such things.
* Ramp   : This is similar to "Linear", but additionally applies an
           exponentiation of the interpolation factor.
